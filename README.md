This repository aims to help DSTI students share and collaborate on some courses' notes, particularly on mathematics.

Please note that this is my first time trying to set up a GitHub repo to collaborate, so any help would be appreciated.

# Usage

## 1 Obsidian User

I strongly recommend to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) ( a free, local, knowledge management tool) to read and edit those notes. There are some simple YouTube videos about Obsidian. No need to dig into the pluggins and the complex stuff.

Once downloaded, just launch Obsidian and select 'Open a Vault', then choose this repository.

## 2 Non-Obsidian User
You can simply access the notes in markdown format through this repo.

# Regarding the existing notes
I've already took and linked numerous notes regarding DSTI courses but it would be too long to share all of them. This vault currently only contains notes about the Warm-Up Mathematics class (1/4 of the course, but more will come).

# Collaborating
I'm still struggling to find the best way to organize my mathematics notes. There are certainly some mistakes, so feel free to correct them by cloning this repo. 
Right now, I would suggest that:
- Each definition, proposition, property, proof... should have its own heading (#) so it is easier to reference them and directly access them when needed
- When possible, give a name to the headings (e.g. 'Property - associativity', 'Proposition - composition of subjections'... )
- Try to provide a meaningful commit message ('fix: ...', 'add :...')
